# smart-campus-navigation-system

## About this project
- As you navigate the campus, you start to discover various paths. At times, you may wonder which path would be the fastest to reach your destination.
This navigation project has been created to showcase three algorithms that you can use to map your path: Dijkstra, Breadth First Search (BFS), and Depth First Search (DFS).
